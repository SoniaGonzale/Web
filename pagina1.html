            <img src="images/inicio1.jpg" alt="Descripción de la imagen" class="img-fluid mb-3">
            <p class="text-justify small">The pioneers We were born at the beginning of April 1984. A few days before, the neighborhood had been kicked by the young people, 
              leaving an informative circular in the houses in the name of a management committee, saying that the intention was to form a fault and 
              that he expected the cooperation of the neighborhood. </p>

              <p class="text-justify small">The origin comes from a couple of years before, in the fallera week of 1982. Some revelers, neighbors of the neighborhood, were motivated to the 
              foundation when other residents asked them why, if they liked to be falleras and participated in the party were not trying to create a commission 
              next to the house. They were nothing more than provocations that remained in the air, since they replied that the idea did not seem bad to them, 
              but that an "Initial Force" from usport was needed to intervene.</p>
              
              <p class="text-justify small">During the fall week of 1984, in full festive fervor, the attempt was repeated and this time the "initial force" was more evident, more willing. 
              So at the end of the exercise, they were left to make a call and try it. There were few who were there to lead the adventure, but, in a careful 
              way and with supporters of the idea, it seemed that there were more people. They put their hands on the oba, printed the circulars and distributed them. 
              They were ahead....</p>
              <p class="text-justify small">in 1988-1989 we changed homes again: we had the opportunity to rent a bigger place (the one we had is starting to get small) and closer to the cotton where the fallas were planted. 
              Although Apuntà was low again, a great effort was made to condition it.</p>

            <img src="images/inicio5.jpg" alt="inicio5" class="img-fluid mb-3">
            <p class="text-justify small">In the financial year 1990-1991, an "invention" was released (which the falla didn't invent, it was already invented) 
              revolutionizing the layout of the booklet that had been made until now. The proposal was to do it about Mestre Serrano, 
              taking advantage of the fiftieth anniversary of his death. In addition, the format changed, the assembly and framing had to be different and had to be signed, 
              added and personalized. </p>
              <p class="text-justify small">The following years were of transfers, in 1992-1993, it began with a new president: Vicent Sanchis, founder of the commission. 
              And with location problems. The owner of the basement where the house was located said that, as the contract was coming to an end and she had a very substantial 
              offer, she saw the need to terminate it, as she understood that the failure could not be equaled with the income they had proposed </p>
              <p class="text-justify small">In the 1994-1995 financial year, although the census dropped, the desire to make this commission bigger continued to grow. At the time of making the monument, 
              as the economy was short - an endemic evil of the neighborhood alleys -, it was decided to buy the dolls and the rest to be done by the fools themselves.</p> 
              <p class="text-justify small">All this, we had another problem which, unfortunately, we were subscribed to: the rental contract for the house was coming to an end and they did not want 
              to renew it. He returned to the boat and captured another space. It was found in what had been the headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses. In addition, 
              that year it was requested to be able to make the banana on the corner of Calle Pintor Ribera with García Lorca, a request that was approved..</p>

            <p class="text-justify small">During the 94-95 financial year, although the census dropped, the desire to make this commission bigger continued to grow. When it came to making the monument, 
              as the economy was short - an endemic evil of the neighborhood's fallas -, it was decided to buy the dolls and the rest to be done by the fallas themselves.</p>
            <p class="text-justify small">On top of that, he had another problem that, unfortunately, we were subscribed to: the rental contract for the house was coming to an end and they didn't want to renew it. 
              It is back to the search and capture of a new space. It was found in what had been the headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses. In addition, that year there was a request to be able to make 
              the banana on the corner of Carrer Pintor Ribera with García Lorca, a request that was approved.</p>
            <p class="text-justify small">In 1997-1998 the census began to improve and new sap was coming in. The choice was made again for the children's monument and this year there was unanimity in the criteria, 
              because they gave us the First Prize and the prize for ingenuity and grace. In addition, we had the joy of the humble: we could afford, after many years, to have a band again at the Offering.</p>
            <p class="text-justify small">Following them the following year, the president cnavigated, entering a faller who had already been a children's representative, who loved the falla as the most and who, in the long run, 
              would give him the stability he needed: José Miguel Pérez. As an anecdote, it should be noted that at that time he became, at the age of 20, the youngest president of the entire Community. 
              During this year the Station adopted the color red in the scarf, a sign of identity that was already beginning to be seen in Valencia, but which was a pioneer in Benetússer and which we continue to maintain.</p>

            <img src="images/inicio2.jpg" alt="Descripción de la imagen" class="img-fluid mb-3">
            <p  class="text-justify small">In 2001-2002 the good economic situation of the commission was a fact and we could afford to raise the budgets. We had good expectations for the monuments, although the reality is sometimes cruel. 
              Arriving on the day of the plant just talk to the artist and he told us that he would come. But it didn't appear, we had half of the children's fault. Hours passed and we knew nothing. 
              In the next exercise, as is clear, we will change darts. Thanks to all, it was a success. we will rely on Vicent Llácer, who debuted that year in the Valencia Special Section. 
              Sometimes this was noticed in the quality of the monuments.</p>
            <p class="text-justify small">In 2003-2004 was a year with few changes. Only the children's fall artists, who turned out to be two boys from Alicante, D. vValero and J. Benitez, 
              who made us a falla with Don Quixote as the central figure and won the First Prize.
              We also gathered fruit at the Presentation as it was the 20th anniversary, it was set up like a children's party with clowns who welcomed the committee on top of the stage, 
              which gave us the opportunity to also celebrate the First Prize.</p>
            <p class="text-justify small">In 2004-2005 Vicent Llacer was already integrated into the idiosyncrasies of the commission and felt at home. and this will be transferred to his work and won the first prize.</p>

            <p class="text-justify small">These years marked the beginning of a stage, changing the president: Pepe Vidal had expressed his desire to run for office and José Miguel, who had a long career at the head of the commission, 
              took advantage of the situation to rest from default obligations.</p>
            <p class="text-justify small">As it was already tradition, we will change the children's artist again. This time it was Fernando López, a small young man eager to learn and grow as an artist.
               The bet didn't go badly for us, as we won the First Children's Prize. For his part, Vicent llácer repeated am the second and the first of ingenuity and grace.
              A post-Fernando Exercise made us tame another joy by obtaining the second prize and that of ingenuity and grace. La falla won, for the first time, the first prize in the music category of 
              the Junta Local Fallera Playbacks competition with Mary Pioppins..</p>
              <p class="text-justify small">In 2010-2011 we assumed the end of a cycle regarding the monument, putting an end to the relationship that united us since 2003 with Vicent Llacer, 
                the longest-serving artist and one of the most awarded in our history. Yes, in the worst possible way, as all endings tend to be
                during lunch on the 18th of March, all those who were in the house erupted a loud noise that came from the grain fault. 
                When they went out to check what it was all about, they discovered that the finish was coming apart. 
                They tried to find some rope to fix the monument and avoid the possible fall, but it didn't give any fear. Gravity took its toll and the fault collapsed.</p>
                <p class="text-justify small">It wasn't all bad because we won the first prize in the Musical category of the playback contest with Aladdin's number</p>

            <p class="text-justify small">In 20011-2012 Jose Vicente Rodriguez took the position of president that he had left behind a couple of years ago with the task of finding artists. 
              It's a complex job and that every failure must keep in mind (or so he would say), since it's like launching a coin in the air Perhaps because he is a man of fault and with experience, 
              he decided to allocate his efforts to the rest of the contests where the commission was working. The result was successful..</p>
            <p class="text-justify small">We will lock in this much-desired stability until 2013-2014. We trusted Latorre and Sanz for the big moment where they did a great job, 
              although the best was yet to come. This year they had neither Fallera Mayor nor children's president, but José Miguel Pérez returned to occupy the position of president for 
              what would be our 25th anniversary.</p>
            <p class="text-justify small">They were growth exercises for the commission. The Añpunta events were a success and the social mass reached a figure that had rarely been seen in our country. 
              The Festejos and children's delegates had a great job.</p>

              With the 35th anniversary came, probably, the most glorious year of the falla. He took the helm of the commission Juan Vicente Sanchis, cradle faller. Trying to involve and give competitiveness 
              to this wide census, they organized some good contests and the commission responded.</p>
            <p class="text-justify small">Result: 10 pennants, 4 of them first prizes.
              For the anniversary we want to renew and beautify ourselves and we will paint the facade of the church with a mural of the dolls from our award-winning monuments. 
              Too bad we won't be able to enjoy it for a long time.</p>

              The difficulties that it brought to an association with ours are obvious, but if that wasn't enough, we also had to change our house, since the owner of the building was going 
              to renovate it. With the attention of finding a space that would accommodate all the fallers, we will move to a spacious basement on Calle Pintor Ribera, although at that moment
               we had already lost practically half of the 120 people.</p>

            <p class="text-justify small">a year later it was Paco Casanova who assumed the presidency in a complicated time. 
              We came back little by little and it was up to us to rebuild ourselves as a fault. We will recover part of the census, including welcoming new fallers,
